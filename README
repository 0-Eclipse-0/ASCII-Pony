ASCII Ponies
============

ASCII art of some characters from My Little Pony: Friendship is magic.

Available Characters
--------------------

* Twilight Sparkle (Both as unicorn and as alicorn)
* Rainbow Dash (Both with open and closed wing)
* Fluttershy
* Rairy
* Pinkie Pie
* Applejack (Both with and without hat)
* Derpy
* Trixie (Both with and without hat)
* Rose
* Lyra Heartstrings
* DJ Pon3 (Both with and without shades)
* Princess Celestia
* Princess Luna

Scripts and stuff
-----------------

Each final character is divided into separate file, one for each color.
The file name is what you'd put in an ANSI escape to make it colored.
The script render_parts.php takes a directory as input and scans for such files.
It produces the following kinds of output:

* ANSI-Encoded Colored text (default)
* Plaintext (if you pass nocolor)
* SVG (if you pass svg)

Being a PHP script it requires PHP in order to run it.

The makefile will compile all of the above, the plaintext in the same directory 
as the parent of the directory containing the various part files, everythin else
in /rendered.
It will also call Inkscape to generate PNG images from the SVG.

You can cat the colored files on a terminal to see the fancy output (as long as 
the terminal supports colors).

Some blank ponies and a template directory can be found inside the 
directory /Generic
