System Pony
-----------

systempony is a script which shows a pony and system information.
It can be installed system-wide using "make install" (PREFIX selects the
target directory).

The global config is found in $PREFIX/share/ascii-pony/systempony.conf,
(or ./systempony.conf if not installed), user config is in ~/.systempony.

Config Variables:
* PONY   : a pony identifier or "random",
           see "./systempony --list" for a list of identifiers
* INFO   : an array of system info to display, "./systempony -h" for a list
* FSTYPE : a file system type used to calculate disk usage (Uses df),
           if empty it will show the total.

Requirements:
    * lsb-release for Distro
    * lxc for Containers
    * bc for CPU_Usage

Generating Images
-----------------

Each final character is divided into a separate file, one for each color.
The file name is what you'd put in an ANSI escape to make it colored.
The script render_parts.php takes a directory as input and scans for such files.
It produces the following kinds of output:

* ANSI-Encoded Colored text (default)
* Plaintext (if you pass nocolor)
* SVG (if you pass svg)

Being a PHP script, it requires PHP in order to run.

The makefile will compile all of the above, the plaintext in the same directory
as the parent of the directory containing the various part files,
and everything else in /rendered.

It will also call Inkscape to generate PNG images from the SVG.

You can cat the colored files on a terminal to see the fancy output (as long as
the terminal supports colors).

Some blank ponies and a template directory can be found inside the
directory /Generic

Installing as MOTD
------------------

### pam.d

Ensure /etc/pam.d/login has the following line:

    session    optional   pam_motd.so  motd=/run/motd.dynamic

Note it does not end with `noupdate`.

Then (for a single pony picture) copy one of the files under rendered/sh to 
/etc/update-motd.d with a name like 20-pony or something like that.

If instead you want to use systempony in the motd, first install it system-wide
(with `make install`), then create the appropriate script that would call it.
